# This is my first personal project.
The project was during a 2 month peroid on 50% study tempo(Code only, the graphic was made in another course we had at the same time). 

Note: This is a copy of the original repo, the original repo is a private one given to me by the course turtors.

## It's a game about a mighty potato, what more could you ask for?
The game is webb-based and written in Javascript. It has a lvl and skill system and combat against really simpel AI's. Alot is also randomly generated, each time you play a map is randomly generated, aswell as the contents for each area. 
A 'waring' is that the main script is a mess. At the start of the project I was just adding functionallity after functionallity without thinking ahead and got it all in one big script, the further I got the more I realised how messy the code became, I did what I could and broke out some stuff into their own scripts but it's still a huge mess. You live and you learn.
